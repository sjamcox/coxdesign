      <h1>Hello, my name is Sam. I design digital and analog experiences.</h1>
        <p>I get immense joy from creating things that please the senses. From a clean user interface to the perfect cup of coffee, life's too short to settle for middle-of-the-road.</p>
        <p>I got into graphic design and web design to solve problems.</p>
        <p>I currently work at the <a href="https://www.ymcacw.org/">YMCA of Columbia-Willamette</a>, connecting kids, adults and families to programs that build a healthy spirit, body and mind.</p>
        <h3>Interested in working with me for a future project?</h3>
